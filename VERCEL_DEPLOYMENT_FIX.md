# Vercel Deployment Fix

## The Error
```
Header at index 2 has invalid `source` pattern "/(.*\.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|eot))".
```

## What Caused It
The error was caused by using JavaScript regex syntax in Vercel's configuration file. Vercel doesn't support the same regex patterns as JavaScript.

## The Fix
I've updated the `vercel.json` file to use Vercel-compatible patterns:

### Option 1: Use the Updated vercel.json (Recommended)
The current `vercel.json` now uses simple, compatible patterns:
- `/(.*)` - matches all routes for SPA routing
- `/static/(.*)` - matches static files
- `/assets/(.*)` - matches Vite's asset files

### Option 2: Use the Simple Configuration
If you still get errors, rename `vercel-simple.json` to `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel configuration"
git push
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel
- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- The deployment should automatically trigger
- If it fails, try redeploying

### 3. Environment Variables
Make sure to add these in your Vercel dashboard:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `VITE_FONNTE_TOKEN`

### 4. Test the Deployment
After deployment, test:
- [ ] Home page loads
- [ ] Login page works
- [ ] All routes work when refreshed
- [ ] No 404 errors on page refresh

## Troubleshooting

### If you still get errors:
1. **Use the simple config**: Rename `vercel-simple.json` to `vercel.json`
2. **Check Vercel logs**: Look at the deployment logs for specific errors
3. **Clear cache**: Try redeploying with a fresh deployment

### Alternative: Use Netlify
If Vercel continues to have issues, you can use Netlify instead:
- The `netlify.toml` file is already configured
- Just connect your GitHub repo to Netlify
- It should work without any configuration changes

## What the Configuration Does

### SPA Routing
- All routes redirect to `index.html` for client-side routing
- Fixes the 404 error when refreshing pages

### Caching
- Static files get long-term caching
- Improves performance

### Security Headers
- XSS protection
- Content type options
- Frame options

The updated configuration should resolve the deployment error and make your site work properly on Vercel!
